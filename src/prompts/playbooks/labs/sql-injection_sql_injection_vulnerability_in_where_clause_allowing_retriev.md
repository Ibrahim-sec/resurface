## SQL injection vulnerability in WHERE clause allowing retrieval of hidden data

**Category:** sqli
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab contains a SQL injection vulnerability in the product category filter. When the user selects a category, the application carries out a SQL query like the following:

### Solution Steps
1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify the request that sets the product category filter.
2. Modify the category parameter, giving it the value '+OR+1=1--
3. Submit the request, and verify that the response now contains one or more unreleased products.

### Key Payloads
- `SELECT * FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts' AND released = 1`
- `category`
- `'+OR+1=1--`

### Indicators of Success
- SQL syntax errors reveal injection point
- UNION SELECT returns additional data
- Boolean conditions change response
- Time delays confirm blind injection
- Database contents extracted
