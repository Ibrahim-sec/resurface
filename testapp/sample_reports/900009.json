  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe search functionality at `/search-safe` was previously vulnerable to Reflected XSS via the `q` parameter. A fix was applied using HTML escaping.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the safe search page\n2. Try the XSS payload:\n   ```\n   /search-safe?q=<script>alert(document.domain)</script>\n   ```\n3. Check if the payload is reflected unescaped in the response\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```http\nGET /search-safe?q=<script>alert(document.domain)</script> HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\n```\n\nExpected fixed behavior: The response should contain `&lt;script&gt;alert(document.domain)&lt;/script&gt;` instead of raw HTML tags.\n\n## Impact\nIf the fix is proper, the XSS payload should be HTML-encoded and not execute.",
