  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe `/redirect` endpoint accepts an arbitrary URL via the `url` parameter and performs a 302 redirect without any validation. This allows attackers to craft links that appear to come from the trusted domain but redirect users to malicious sites.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the target application\n2. Craft a URL with an external redirect target:\n   ```\n   /redirect?url=https://evil.com/phishing\n   ```\n3. The server responds with HTTP 302 and `Location: https://evil.com/phishing`\n4. The browser follows the redirect to the attacker's site\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```http\nGET /redirect?url=https://evil.com/phishing HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\n```\n\nResponse:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: https://evil.com/phishing\n```\n\n## Impact\n- Phishing attacks using the trusted domain as a stepping stone\n- Credential theft by redirecting to fake login pages\n- Malware distribution via trusted-looking URLs\n- Bypass of URL-based security filters and email scanners",
