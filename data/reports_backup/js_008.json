  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe Juice Shop application exposes several unauthenticated endpoints that leak sensitive information about the application's internals, configuration, and dependencies.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n\n### Endpoint 1: Application configuration\n1. Send the following request (no authentication required):\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/rest/admin/application-configuration\n```\n2. The response contains the full application configuration\n\n### Endpoint 2: Application version and info\n1. Send the following request:\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/rest/admin/application-version\n```\n2. Returns the exact application version\n\n### Endpoint 3: FTP directory listing\n1. Navigate to:\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/ftp\n```\n2. Returns a listing of files on the server including internal documents:\n   - acquisitions.md\n   - coupons_2013.md.bak\n   - eastere.gg\n   - encrypt.pyc\n   - package.json.bak\n   - quarantine/ directory\n\n## Impact\nMedium — These endpoints expose internal application details that aid further attacks:\n- Application version enables targeted exploit selection\n- Configuration may reveal security settings, API keys, or feature flags\n- FTP listing exposes internal files, backup files, and potentially sensitive data\n- Combined with other vulnerabilities, this information significantly reduces attack complexity\n\n## Expected Behavior\nAdministrative and internal endpoints should require authentication and proper authorization. File directory listing should be disabled.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nThese endpoints are publicly accessible without any authentication, exposing internal application data."
