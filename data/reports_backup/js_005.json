  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe OWASP Juice Shop exposes an FTP directory at /ftp/ that serves files. The application attempts to restrict access to the /ftp/ directory but the path validation can be bypassed using null byte injection (URL-encoded as %2500) to traverse outside the allowed directory.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to http://localhost:3333/ftp to see the public file listing\n2. Attempt to access a file outside the ftp directory:\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/ftp/eastere.gg%2500.md\n```\n3. The server returns the contents of the hidden easter egg file that should not be accessible\n4. For further traversal, try:\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/ftp/package.json%2500.md\n```\n5. This returns the application's package.json file, exposing dependency information\n\n## Impact\nAn attacker can read files outside the intended FTP directory by bypassing the file extension check with a null byte. This can expose sensitive configuration files, source code, and application secrets.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nThe application should properly validate file paths and reject any path traversal attempts. Null bytes should be stripped or rejected.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nThe application's file extension validation is bypassed by the null byte, allowing access to files with any extension outside the allowed list."
