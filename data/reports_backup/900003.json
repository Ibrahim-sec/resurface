  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe `/redirect` endpoint accepts a `url` parameter and performs a 302 redirect to the specified URL without any validation. This allows an attacker to craft links that appear to come from the trusted domain but redirect victims to malicious websites.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Navigate to the following URL:\n   ```\n   /redirect?url=https://evil.com\n   ```\n2. The server responds with HTTP 302 and Location header pointing to `https://evil.com`\n3. The browser automatically follows the redirect to the attacker-controlled site\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```http\nGET /redirect?url=https://evil.com HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\n```\n\nResponse:\n```\nHTTP/1.1 302 Found\nLocation: https://evil.com\n```\n\nThe server blindly redirects to any URL provided in the parameter.\n\n## Impact\n- Phishing attacks using the trusted domain as a launchpad\n- OAuth token theft if used in authentication flows\n- Bypass of URL-based security filters that whitelist the trusted domain",
