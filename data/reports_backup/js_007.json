  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe Juice Shop administration panel is accessible by navigating directly to the admin path. The application only hides the admin link from the UI for non-admin users but does not enforce server-side access controls on the admin routes.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. Log in as any regular user at http://localhost:3333/#/login\n2. Navigate directly to the administration panel:\n```\nhttp://localhost:3333/#/administration\n```\n3. The administration page loads and displays:\n   - All registered user accounts with emails\n   - All customer feedback/reviews\n   - Ability to delete reviews\n   - User recycle requests\n\n## Alternative PoC — via API\n1. With any valid authentication token, send:\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/api/Users\nAuthorization: Bearer <regular_user_token>\n```\n2. All user data is returned including admin accounts\n\n## Impact\nCritical — Any authenticated user can access the full administration panel, view all user data, and perform administrative actions like deleting feedback. This is a complete bypass of the authorization model.\n\n## Expected Behavior\nThe administration routes and API endpoints should verify that the authenticated user has admin role before granting access.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nAuthorization checks are only performed client-side (UI element visibility). Server-side endpoints serve admin data to any authenticated user."
