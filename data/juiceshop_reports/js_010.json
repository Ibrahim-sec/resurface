  "vulnerability_information": "## Summary\nThe product review API endpoint returns the email addresses of users who posted reviews. This information is exposed to any user (including unauthenticated users) who views product details.\n\n## Steps to Reproduce\n1. No authentication is required\n2. Send the following request to get reviews for a product:\n```\nGET http://localhost:3333/rest/products/1/reviews\n```\n3. The response contains review objects with full author email addresses:\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"message\": \"One of my all-time favourites!\",\n    \"author\": \"admin@juice-sh.op\",\n    \"product\": 1,\n    \"likesCount\": 0\n  }\n]\n```\n4. Repeat for other product IDs (1-37) to enumerate user email addresses\n5. This exposes email addresses including admin accounts\n\n## Impact\nMedium — User email addresses are exposed without authentication. This enables:\n- User enumeration for targeted attacks\n- Identification of admin accounts (admin@juice-sh.op)\n- Phishing campaigns using legitimate email addresses\n- Credential stuffing attacks using harvested emails\n\n## Expected Behavior\nProduct reviews should either anonymize the author field or use a display name instead of the raw email address.\n\n## Actual Behavior\nFull email addresses of review authors are returned in the API response without any anonymization."
