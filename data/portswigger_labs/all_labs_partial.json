    "solution": "1. Log in and send a request containing your session cookie to Burp Repeater. Highlight the cookie and look at the Inspector panel.\n2. Notice that the cookie contains a Base64-encoded token, signed with a SHA-1 HMAC hash.\n3. Copy the decoded cookie from the Inspector and paste it into Decoder.\n4. In Decoder, highlight the token and then select Decode as > Base64 . Notice that the token is actually a serialized PHP object.\n5. In Burp Repeater, observe that if you try sending a request with a modified cookie, an exception is raised because the digital signature no longer matches. However, you should notice that: A developer comment discloses the location of a debug file at /cgi-bin/phpinfo.php . The error message reveals that the website is using the Symfony 4.3.6 framework.\n6. Request the /cgi-bin/phpinfo.php file in Burp Repeater and observe that it leaks some key information about the website, including the SECRET_KEY environment variable. Save this key; you'll need it to sign your exploit later.\n7. Download the \"PHPGGC\" tool and execute the following command: ./phpggc Symfony/RCE4 exec 'rm /home/carlos/morale.txt' | base64 This will generate a Base64-encoded serialized object that exploits an RCE gadget chain in Symfony to delete Carlos's morale.txt file.\n8. You now need to construct a valid cookie containing this malicious object and sign it correctly using the secret key you obtained earlier. You can use the following PHP script to do this. Before running the script, you just need to make the following changes: Assign the object you generated in PHPGGC to the $object variable. Assign the secret key that you copied from the phpinfo.php file to the $secretKey variable. <?php\n$object = \"OBJECT-GENERATED-BY-PHPGGC\";\n$secretKey = \"LEAKED-SECRET-KEY-FROM-PHPINFO.PHP\";\n$cookie = urlencode('{\"token\":\"' . $object . '\",\"sig_hmac_sha1\":\"' . hash_hmac('sha1', $object, $secretKey) . '\"}');\necho $cookie; This will output a valid, signed cookie to the console.\n9.

In the Parameter handling section, use the drop-down menus to specify that the gift-card parameter should be derived from the prior response (response 4). Click OK .\n12. In the Macro Editor , click Test macro . Look at the response to GET /cart/order-confirmation?order-confirmation=true and note the gift card code that was generated. Look at the POST /gift-card request. Make sure that the gift-card parameter matches and confirm that it received a 302 response. Keep clicking OK until you get back to the main Burp window.\n13. Send the GET /my-account request to Burp Intruder. Make sure that Sniper attack is selected.\n14. In the Payloads side panel, under Payload configuration , select the payload type Null payloads . Choose to generate 412 payloads.\n15. Click on Resource pool to open the Resource pool side panel. Add the attack to a resource pool with the Maximum concurrent requests set to 1 .

Reload the home page and observe that the value from the fehost cookie is reflected inside a double-quoted JavaScript object in the response.\n4. Send this request to Burp Repeater and add a cache-buster query parameter.\n5. Change the value of the cookie to an arbitrary string and resend the request. Confirm that this string is reflected in the response.\n6. Place a suitable XSS payload in the fehost cookie, for example: fehost=someString\"-alert(1)-\"someString\n7. Replay the request until you see the payload in the response and X-Cache: hit in the headers.\n8. Load the URL in the browser and confirm the alert() fires.\n9. Go back Burp Repeater, remove the cache buster, and replay the request to keep the cache poisoned until the victim visits the site and the lab is solved.",
