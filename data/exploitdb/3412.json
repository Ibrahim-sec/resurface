It has a threaded daemon which periodically\r\nruns from cron. It works with small .nfo files which hold router\r\ninformation and optionally connection details, colors, min max,\r\nbandwidth settings, etc, etc. RRDBrowse uses a small caching mechanism\r\nto store interface names. It's much MRTG like in it's current state\".\r\nMore information about the product can be found online at\r\nhttp://www.rrdbrowse.org.\r\n\r\nIV - DETAILS\r\n\r\nDue to inproper input validation, the CGI application \"rrdbrowse\"\r\n(versions <=1.6) is vulnerable to an arbitrary file disclosure\r\nvulnerability. It allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to read any\r\nfile on the remote system if the user the webserver is running as has\r\npermissions to do so. Thus an attacker is able to gain access\r\npotentially sensitive information.\r\n\r\nV - EXPLOIT CODE\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is trivial to exploit and only requires specifying an\r\nURL with a relative file path on the remote system such as\r\n\r\nhttp://$target/cgi-bin/rb.cgi?mode=page&file=../../../../../../../../etc/passwd\r\n\r\nAs the input to the \"file\" parameter is not validated in any way\r\naccessing this URL will expose the contents of /etc/passwd to a remote\r\nattacker (interestingly except the first line).\r\n\r\nVI - WORKAROUND/FIX\r\n\r\nTo address this problem, the author of rrdbrowse (Tommy van Leeuwen) has\r\nreleased an updated CVS version (1.7) of the software which is available\r\nat http://www.rrdbrowse.org. Hence all users of rrdbrowse are asked to\r\ntest and install this version as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nVII - DISCLOSURE TIMELINE\r\n\r\n06. February 2007 - Notified vendor\r\n14. Feburary 2007 - Patch/new version released\r\n04. March 2007 - Public disclosure\r\n\r\n# milw0rm.com [2007-03-04]",
