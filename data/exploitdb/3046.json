  "code": "SoftArtisans FileUp viewsrc.asp remote script source disclosure exploit \r\n\r\nAdvisory Name: SoftArtisans FileUp(TM) viewsrc.asp remote script source disclosure exploit \r\nTested and Confirmed Vulerable: SoftArtisans SAFileUp(TM) 5.0.14 (Standard) \r\nSeverity: High Type: Script \r\nsource disclosure From where: Remote \r\nDiscovered by: Inge Henriksen (http://ingehenriksen.blogspot.com/) \r\nVendor Status: Notified Overview: \r\n\r\nSoftArtisans FileUp(TM) is a popular web server component for transactional uploading of files to a \r\nweb server using a web browser. \r\n\r\nWhen installing SoftArtisans FileUp(TM) you should avoid installing the samples as viewsrc.asp can \r\nlet remote anonymous users see script source code or configuration settings outside the \r\n/SAFileUpSamples virtual directory. This is accomplished by modifying the \"path\" query variable to \r\npoint to files outside the designated directory. A web browser from a remote location is a \r\nsufficient tool to see the source code or configuration settings in plain text. \r\n\r\nProof-of Concept: \r\n\r\nThe following url would show the configuration settings for www.example.xom: \r\n\r\nhttp://www.example.xom/SAFileUpSamples/util/viewsrc.asp?path=/SAFileUpSamples/%c0%ae./%c0%ae./web.config \r\n\r\n\r\nThe %c0%ae is Unicode for the \".\" character on a english language server, the url is therefore \r\ninterpreted by the server as \r\nhttp://www.example.xom/SAFileUpSamples/util/viewsrc.asp?path=/SAFileUpSamples/../../web.config, in \r\naddition the unicode character avoids the security checks inside the code of viewsrc.asp which won't \r\nlet any \"..\" pass through. Keep in mind that other unicode's will also work. Also note that OS'es \r\nwith other language settings will be vulnerable to different unicodes, thus %c0%ae might not work on \r\na chinese server but some other unicode's should work just as well. \r\n\r\n# milw0rm.com [2006-12-30]",
